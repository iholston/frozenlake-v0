# frozenlake-v0
Solution to the OpenAI Gym environment of the [FrozenLake-v0](https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0/) through Q-Learning

## Synopsis
This is a trivial but insightful implementation of Reinforcement Learning as an introduction to Q-learning for me. I wanted to see the agent's "brain" update in real time to get a solid understanding of what is actually going on. I've run it on Python 3.7 on Windows 10. The gui was an ambitious project while I was on a plane from Colorado to DC, it was never finished.
